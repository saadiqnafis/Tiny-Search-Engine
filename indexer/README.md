### Indexer

This directory has the files `indexer.c` which is the implementation of our `indexer` module. It has the `Makefile` that we can use to compile crawler and run the test. Moreover, we have our test file `testing.sh` and our output file `testing.out`. We also have `testindex.c` for testing `index` module in `common` directory.
We have `make clean` tha removes files produced by Make or our tests.
We also have `make test` that tests our indexer.

We save the output of our tests using `make test >& testing.out`
