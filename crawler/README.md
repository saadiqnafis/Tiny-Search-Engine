### Crawler

This directory has the files `crawler.c` which is the implementation of our `crawler` module. It has the `Makefile` that we can use to compile crawler and run the test. It also has the directory `data` that stores our outputs. Moreover, we have our test file `testing.sh` and our output file `testing.out`
We have `make clean` tha removes files produced by Make or our tests.
We also have `make test` that tests our crawler.

We save the output of our tests using `make test &> testing.out`
